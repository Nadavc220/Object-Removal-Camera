# Object-Removal-Camera

This is an academic project. The main idea is to create an algorithm which recieves a static video which is crowded by people
and outputs a single "clean" image with every thing else besides the people using a Detection network (YOLO V3) and classic image processing ideas to recreate the image with "clean" detected paches.
